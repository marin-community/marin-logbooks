# Quarter-power EMA-Gram preconditioning on Delphi

## Question and decision criteria

Does alpha=1/4 improve held-out loss over alpha=0 and alpha=1/2 after
independent learning-rate and ridge tuning? Compare alpha in
{0, 1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2}. The [protocol](../../experiments/ema_gram/README.md)
defines the EMA update, fixed controls, selection lock, paired seeds and
checkpoint probes. Training results are pending.

The initial comparison uses the 447M Delphi recipe. Thirty 250M-token pilot
cells tune rates and ridges. Expand edge winners before selecting settings.
Then run fresh 1.2B-token confirmations with three paired initialization/data
seeds. Norm-matched checkpoint probes and exact-SVD comparisons distinguish
step magnitude from directional and approximation effects. Choose and lock a
common held-out loss target from the pilot curves before confirmations.
Horizon and 998M-parameter follow-ups require reproducible confirmation evidence.

## Baseline

Implementation source: Marin commit
`0a71417cdcc76713669c3a014f07ba26358f3c79`, submitted in
[PR #10790](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/pull/10790).
Twenty-five focused tests pass. GitHub CI passed and automated review reported
no remaining actionable issues at this commit. These checks establish software
behavior, not training quality. The proposed four-CPU gradient-reduction test
was removed because it did not exercise the native trainer.

Earlier Ali experiments include [#6588](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/pull/6588)
and [#4919](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/4919).
Their results do not establish the behavior of the new EMA-Gram update.

## Entries

### 2026-10-30 18:30 UTC — Execution plan

The initial pilot LR centers are 0.01, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001 and 0.0005 in
ascending alpha order. They are starting grids, not tuned recommendations.
The baseline center is near conventional Muon update scales; progressively
smaller centers for larger powers are exploratory because the trace-normalized
inverse powers can amplify weak Gram eigendirections. Selection will use
measured held-out loss and expand every edge winner. No center is assumed optimal.
`pilots.json` preserves all 30 cells; `first-pilot.json` selects the nearest
baseline rate to 0.01 for the first complete pilot. Pilot seeds are zero.

Use Iris CPU coordinators in us-central2; training children request TPU v4-8
beside the existing Delphi caches. Keep Iris's default preemption retry policy
and omit all queue, job and training-phase wall-clock limits. Do not release
any GPU allocation voluntarily. This plan requests TPUs, not GPUs.
Every training process uses fresh online W&B identity and incremental local
and artifact logs; only verified full-state restoration establishes resume.

Before training, execute the native online W&B logging check on an Iris CPU
worker. Local credential verification succeeded without printing credentials.
The Iris controller is reachable. No accelerator job has been submitted yet.
Publish this source and the plan before execution; record the resulting exact
commit and job identity in the next entry.

Commands (from the published research checkout):

```bash
uv run --no-sync iris --cluster=marin job run --no-wait --no-cancel-on-exit \
  --job-name ema-gram-20-logging-20261030 --priority batch --cpu 1 --memory 2GB \
  --region us-central2 --extra cpu \
  --sync-package marin-core --sync-package marin-levanter \
  -- python -m experiments.ema_gram.train \
  --plan logbooks/20-ema-gram-polar/first-pilot.json \
  --version 2026.10.30.20 --output /tmp/ema-gram-resolved.json --logging-check
```

After successful remote logging validation, submit the same launcher with
`--run` instead of `--logging-check` and a distinct coordinator name. Inspect
actual memory, step time, numerical stability and data/evaluation progress
before scheduling further pilot cells. Each pilot runs its requested 7,630
updates; this is not a wall-clock cutoff. Durable resolved configurations are
also available through the execution artifacts and online W&B run.

### 2026-10-30 18:35 UTC — Batch scheduling requirement

The first CPU logging-check submission was rejected before a job was launched:
the submitting budget identity permits at most the batch priority band. Use
`--priority batch` on coordinators; do not request interactive priority or
change account policy. No optimizer steps or W&B run occurred in this rejected
submission. The exact experimental source remains unchanged.

### 2026-10-30 18:35 UTC — Remote logging check submitted

Published execution source: `44c7eceff45d94ab2dce7c028f86bb16a34173be`.
Iris accepted CPU job `/kaiyuew@stanford.edu/ema-gram-20-logging-20261030`
with the command above and the permitted batch priority. Its workspace bundle
is 16.0 MB. This job performs no optimizer steps. Await successful completion
and the online W&B run before submitting the first TPU pilot.

## Final decision

Pending pilot, confirmation and checkpoint-probe evidence. No exponent is
selected and no training advantage is claimed. The implementation PR remains
open; its code has not been merged.
